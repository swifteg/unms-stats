# unms-stats

A simple command line tool that fetches recent stats of devices from UNMS and saves them into a SQLite file. For example, it can be used for monitoring signal strength on some access points. 

It is a fire-once script, so to use it for continuous monitoring it can be executed from a cronjob.
